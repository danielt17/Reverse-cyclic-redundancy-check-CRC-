# Reverse cyclic redundancy check (CRC) codes.

CRC reverse engneering is public tool to reverse engineer a CRC code parameters. The tool should be usefull for reverse engneering unknown communication protcols usually in link layer (Frames), especially for RF systems. In the figure below one can easily notice the existence of a CRC field, in case one does not know the CRC generator parameters, given some combinations of packet and CRC's he can recover the CRC generator parameters. This could be useful in case one wants to forge messages to look like valid messages.

## Agenda:

This program was written inorder to migrate CRC-REVENG to python, as being written in C makes it a lot harder to understand and to extended.


## README structure:

I will be going over the following topics:

1. Usage example (example mode and user mode).
2. Requirements.
3. A review of cylic redundancy check codes.
4. The algorithm.
5. Edge cases.

### Usage example:

This code has two modes of operation: 
1. Example mode where the user chooses a CRC from a list to reverse as an example.
2. User mode where the user enters his own packets (data+crc) to reverse the CRC for. 

Starting the program we are given the following options:

```
----------------------------------------

Cyclic redundancy check (CRC) reverse engneering tool.

----------------------------------------



There are two modes of running the tool: example mode, by choosing some known CRC with its full parameters, or user mode in which the user eneters his own packet with data and CRC values concatenated.

To enter example mode press 1, for user mode press 2.
```

#### Example mode:

Lets say we choose example mode by entering 1. we are now asked to choose out of a list of CRCs a CRC to reverse, the packets will be pregenerated.

#### User mode:
