## Reporting a vulnerability

Do not disclose vulnerabilities in public issues.

Use one of these options:

- GitHub private vulnerability reporting (preferred)
- Directly contact the maintainer and include "Security Report" in the subject

Please include:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact assessment
- Suggested remediation, if available

Reports are reviewed on a best-effort basis; no fixed response timeline is guaranteed.
